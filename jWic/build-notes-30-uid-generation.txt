- what's the list of existing uids?
- where is it located?

- use a synchronized hashset
- store (read/write) the hashset locally
- on uid.war redeploy ... how to restore data

    store it at webapps?
    store it in 01-amp3s?
    store it in the database?


- write serialized hashset to /opt/tomcat/webapps.

- on deployment
     if /opt/tomcat/webapps/uidhashset.dat exists read it
     if not create a new one
