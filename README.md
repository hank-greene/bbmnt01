A desire to listen to a bunch of old Amway and sermon tapes inspired the creation of this site, this locally run server (which crashed a while ago).

Previous work over the years with jWic propelled its continued usage as the web framewrok for this sytem.

Orinially called Brown Box Motivation and Training pics of the site follow.
